# TODO: Fix Pages Not Rendering Bug

## Current Task: Solve workflow issues with issue pages not rendering after clicking issues card

### Steps to Complete:
- [x] Add authentication check in App.jsx for protected routes
- [x] Improve error handling in IssueDetails.jsx for store loading
- [x] Add loading states in DashboardLayout
- [x] Ensure store initialization and accessibility
- [x] Add better debugging and fallback UI
- [x] Test navigation and rendering after fixes

### Analysis Summary:
- DashboardLayout requires authentication and returns null if not authenticated
- Auth store uses persist middleware but starts with isAuthenticated: false
- Store has mock data with string ids matching params
- Navigation and routing appear correct

### Potential Issues Identified:
- Authentication blocking page rendering
- Store accessibility at runtime
- Missing loading states
- Error handling in components

### Next Steps:
- Implement authentication checks
- Add loading and error states
- Test fixes thoroughly
